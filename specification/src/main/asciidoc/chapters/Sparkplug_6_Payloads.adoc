[[payloads_overview]]
=== Overview

The MQTT specification does not define any required data payload format. From an MQTT infrastructure
standpoint, the payload is treated as an agnostic binary array of bytes that can be anything from no
payload at all, to a maximum of 256MB. But for applications within a known solution space to work
using MQTT the payload representation does need to be defined.

This section of the Eclipse Sparkplug specification defines how MQTT Sparkplug payloads are encoded
and the data that is required. Sparkplug supports multiple payloads encoding definitions. There is
an 'A' payload format as well as a 'B' payload format. As described in the
link:#introduction_define_the_mqtt_payload[Introduction Section] Sparkplug A is deprecated and is
not included in this document. This section will only cover the details of the Sparkplug 'B' payload
format.

The majority of devices connecting into next generation IIoT infrastructures are legacy equipment
using poll/response protocols. This means we must take in account register based data from devices
that talk protocols like Modbus. The existing legacy equipment needs to work in concert with
emerging IIoT equipment that is able to leverage message transports like MQTT natively.

[[payloads_google_protocol_buffers]]
=== Google Protocol Buffers

*_"Protocol Buffers are a way of encoding structured data in an efficient yet extensible format."_*

Google Protocol Buffers, sometimes referred to as "Google Protobufs", provide the efficiency of
packed binary data encoding while providing the structure required to make it easy to create,
transmit, and parse register based process variables using a standard set of tools while enabling
emerging IIoT requirements around richer metadata. Google Protocol Buffers development tools are
available for:

* C
* C++
* C#
* Java
* Python
* GO
* JavaScript

Additional information on Google Protocol Buffers can be found at:

[[payloads_sparkplug_a_mqtt_payload_definition]]
=== Sparkplug A MQTT Payload Definition

As described in the link:#introduction_define_the_mqtt_payload[Introduction Section] Sparkplug A is
deprecated and is not included in this document.

[[payloads_sparkplug_b_mqtt_payload_definition]]
=== Sparkplug B MQTT Payload Definition

The goal of Sparkplug is to provide a specification that both OEM device manufactures and
application developers can use to create rich and interoperable SCADA/IIoT solutions using MQTT as a
base messaging technology. In the Sparkplug B message payload definition, the goal was to create a
simple and straightforward binary message encoding that could be used primarily for legacy register
based process variables (Modbus register value for example).

The Sparkplug B MQTT payload format has come about based on the feedback from many system
integrators and end users who wanted to be able to natively support a much richer data model within
the MQTT infrastructures that they were designing and deploying. Using the feedback from the user
community Sparkplug B provides support for:

* Complex data types using templates
* Datasets
* Richer metrics with the ability to add property metadata for each metric
* Metric alias support to maintain rich metric naming while keeping bandwidth usage to a minimum
* Historical data
* File data

The Sparkplug B payload definition creates a bandwidth efficient data transport for real time device
data. For WAN based SCADA/IIoT infrastructures this equates to lower latency data updates while
minimizing the amount of traffic and therefore cellular and/or VSAT bandwidth required. In
situations where bandwidth savings is not the primary concern, the efficient use enables higher
throughput of more data eliminating sensor data that may have previously been left stranded in the
field. It is also ideal for LAN based SCADA infrastructures equating to higher throughput of real
time data to consumer applications without requiring extreme networking topologies and/or equipment.

There are many data encoding technologies available that can all be used in conjunction with MQTT. 
Sparkplug B selected an existing, open, and highly available encoding scheme that efficiently
encodes register based process variables. The encoding technology selected for Sparkplug B is Google
Protocol Buffers.

[[payloads_b_google_protocol_buffer_schema]]
==== Google Protocol Buffer Schema

Using lessons learned on the feedback from the Sparkplug A implementation a new Google Protocol
Buffer schema was developed that could be used to represent and encode the more complex data models
being requested. The entire Google Protocol Buffers definition is below.

[[payloads_b_payload_metric_naming_convention]]
==== Payload Metric Naming Convention

For the remainder of this document JSON will be used to represent components of a Sparkplug B
payload. It is important to note that the payload is a binary encoding and is not actually JSON.
However, JSON representation is used in this document to represent the payloads in a way that is
easy to read. For example, a simple Sparkplug B payload with a single metric can be represented in
JSON as follows:

----
{
        "timestamp": <timestamp>,
        "metrics": [{
                "name": <metric_name>,
                "alias": <alias>,
                "timestamp": <timestamp>,
                "dataType": <datatype>,
                "value": <value>
        }],
        "seq": <sequence_number>
}
----

A simple Sparkplug B payload with values would be represented as follows:

----
{
        "timestamp": 1486144502122,
        "metrics": [{
                "name": "My Metric",
                "alias": 1,
                "timestamp": 1479123452194,
                "dataType": "String",
                "value": "Test"
        }],
        "seq": 2
}
----

Note that the ‘name’ of a metric may be hierarchical to build out proper folder structures for
applications consuming the metric values. For example, in an application where an Edge Node in
connected to several devices or data sources, the ‘name’ could represent discrete folder structures
of:

‘Folder 1/Folder 2/Metric Name’

Using this convention in conjunction with the *group_id*, *edge_node_id* and *device_id* already
defined in the Topic Namespace, consuming applications can organize metrics in the same hierarchical
fashion:

[[payloads_b_sparkplug_bv1_0_payload_components]]
==== Sparkplug B v1.0 Payload Components

The Sparkplug specification link:#topics[Topics Section] defines the Topic Namespace that Sparkplug
uses to publish and subscribe between Edge Nodes and Host Applications within the MQTT
infrastructure. Using that Topic Namespace, this section of the specification defines the actual
payload contents of each message type in Sparkplug B v1.0.

[[payloads_b_payload_component_definitions]]
==== Payload Component Definitions

Sparkplug B consists of a series of one or more metrics with metadata surrounding those metrics. The 
following definitions explain the components that make up a payload.

[[payloads_b_payload]]
==== Payload

A Sparkplug B payload is the top-level component that is encoded and used in an MQTT message. It
contains some basic information such as a timestamp and a sequence number as well as an array of
metrics which contain key/value pairs of data. A Sparkplug B payload includes the following
components.

* *payload*
** _timestamp_
*** This is the timestamp in the form of an unsigned 64-bit integer representing the number of
milliseconds since epoch (Jan 1, 1970).
*** [tck-testable tck-id-payloads-timestamp-in-UTC]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-payloads-timestamp-in-UTC] This
timestamp MUST be in UTC.*#
*** This timestamp represents the time at which the message was published.
** _metrics_
*** This is an array of metrics representing key/value/datatype values. Metrics are further defined 
link:#payloads_b_metric[here].
** _seq_
*** This is the sequence number which is an unsigned 64-bit integer.
**** [tck-testable tck-id-payloads-sequence-num-always-included]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-payloads-sequence-num-always-included] A
sequence number MUST be included in the payload of every Sparkplug MQTT message from an Edge Node
except NDEATH messages.*#
**** [tck-testable tck-id-payloads-sequence-num-req-nbirth]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-payloads-sequence-num-zero-nbirth] A
NBIRTH message from an Edge Node MUST always contain a sequence number between 0 and
18446744073709551615 (inclusive).*#
**** [tck-testable tck-id-payloads-sequence-num-incrementing]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-payloads-sequence-num-incrementing] All
subsequent messages after an NBIRTH from an Edge Node MUST contain a sequence number that is
continually increasing by one in each message from that Edge Node until a value of
18446744073709551615 (max value of a UINT64) is reached. At that point, the sequence number of the
following message MUST be zero.*#
** _uuid_
*** This is a field which can be used to represent a schema or some other specific form of the
message. Example usage would be to supply a UUID which represents an encoding mechanism of the
optional array of bytes associated with a payload.
** _body_
*** This is an array of bytes which can be used for any custom binary encoded data.

[[payloads_b_metric]]
==== Metric

A Sparkplug B metric is a core component of data in the payload. It represents a key, value,
timestamp, and datatype along with metadata used to describe the information it contains. These also
represent 'tags' in classic SCADA systems. It includes the following components.

* *name*
** This is the friendly name of a metric. It should be represented as a forward-slash delimited
UTF-8 string. The slashes in the string represent folders of the metric to represent hierarchical
data structures. For example, ‘outputs/A’ would be a metric with a unique identifier of ‘A’ in the
‘outputs’ folder. There is no limit to the number of folders. However, across the infrastructure of
MQTT publishers a defined folder should always remain a folder.
** [tck-testable tck-id-payloads-name-requirement]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-payloads-name-requirement] The
name MUST be included with every metric unless aliases are being used.*#
** All UTF-8 characters are allowed in the metric name. However, special characters including but
not limited to the following are discouraged: . , \ @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) [ ] { } | ! ` ~ : ; ' " < > ?.
This is because many Sparkplug Host Applications may have issues handling them.

* *alias*
** This is an unsigned 64-bit integer representing an optional alias for a Sparkplug B payload.
Aliases are optional and not required. *If aliases are used, the following rules apply.*
*** [tck-testable tck-id-payloads-alias-uniqueness]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-payloads-alias-uniqueness] If
supplied in an NBIRTH or DBIRTH it MUST be a unique number across this Edge Node's entire set of
metrics.*#
**** Non-normative comment: no two metrics for the same Edge Node can have the same alias. Upon being
defined in the NBIRTH or DBIRTH, subsequent messages can supply only the alias instead of the metric
friendly name to reduce overall message size.
*** [tck-testable tck-id-payloads-alias-birth-requirement]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-payloads-alias-birth-requirement] NBIRTH
and DBIRTH messages MUST include both a metric name and alias.*#
*** [tck-testable tck-id-payloads-alias-data-cmd-requirement]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-payloads-alias-data-cmd-requirement] NDATA,
DDATA, NCMD, and DCMD messages MUST only include an alias and the metric name MUST be excluded.*#
* *timestamp*
** This is the timestamp in the form of an unsigned 64-bit integer representing the number of
milliseconds since epoch (Jan 1, 1970).
** [tck-testable tck-id-payloads-name-birth-data-requirement]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-payloads-name-birth-data-requirement] The
timestamp MUST be included with every metric in all NBIRTH, DBIRTH, NDATA, and DDATA messages.*#
** [tck-testable tck-id-payloads-name-cmd-requirement]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-payloads-name-cmd-requirement] The
timestamp MAY be included with metrics in NCMD and DCMD messages.*#
** [tck-testable tck-id-payloads-metric-timestamp-in-UTC]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-payloads-metric-timestamp-in-UTC] The
timestamp MUST be in UTC.*#
*** Non-normative comment: This timestamp represents the time at which the value of a metric was
captured.
* *datatype*
** [tck-testable tck-id-payloads-metric-datatype-value-type]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-payloads-metric-datatype-value-type] The
datatype MUST be an unsigned 32-bit integer representing the datatype.*#
** [tck-testable tck-id-payloads-metric-datatype-value]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-payloads-metric-datatype-value] The

* *is_historical*
** This is a Boolean flag which denotes whether this metric represents a historical value. In some
cases, it may be desirable to send metrics after they were acquired from a device or Edge Node. This

Transient metrics can be considered those that are of interest to a host application(s) but should
not be stored in a historian.

** The value of a metric utilizes the ‘oneof’ mechanism of Google Protocol Buffers. The value
supplied with a metric MUST be one of the following types. Note if the metrics is_null flag is set
to true the value can be omitted altogether. More information on the Google Protocol Buffer types

and includes the following components.

* *is_multi_part*
** A Boolean representing whether this metric contains part of a multi-part message. Breaking up
large quantities of data can be useful for keeping the flow of MQTT messages flowing through the

messages can result in messages being blocked while delivery of large messages takes place.
* *content_type*
** This is a UTF-8 string which represents the content type of a given metric value if applicable.

----
spBv1.0/Sparkplug B Devices/DREBIRTH/Raspberry Pi/Pibrella
----

In the topic above the following information is known based on the Sparkplug topic definition:

* The ‘Group ID’ is: Sparkplug B Devices
* The ‘Edge Node ID’ is: Raspberry Pi
* The ‘Device ID’ is: Pibrella
* This is a DREBIRTH message based on the 'DREBIRTH' Sparkplug Verb

Consider the following Sparkplug B payload in the DREBIRTH message shown above:

                "dataType": "Boolean",
                "value": false
        }, {
                "name": "Outputs/LEDs/Yellow",
                "timestamp": 1486144502122,
                "dataType": "Boolean",
                "value": false
        }, {
                "name": "Outputs/Buzzer",
                "timestamp": 1486144502122,

                "value": "Pibrella"
        }],
        "seq": 1
}
----

This would result in a structure as follows on the Host Application.

[[payloads_b_ndata]]
==== NDATA

NDATA messages are used to update the values of any Edge Node metrics that were originally published
in the NBIRTH message. Any time an input changes on the Edge Node, a NDATA message should be
generated and published to the MQTT Server. If multiple metrics on the Edge Node change, they can
all be included in a single NDATA message. It is also important to note that changes can be
aggregated and published together in a single NDATA message. Because the Sparkplug B payload uses
an ordered List of metrics, multiple different change events for multiple different metrics can all
be included in a single NDATA message.

* [tck-testable tck-id-payloads-ndata-timestamp]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-payloads-ndata-timestamp] NDATA
messages MUST include a payload timestamp that denotes the time at which the message was
published.*#
* [tck-testable tck-id-payloads-ndata-seq]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-payloads-ndata-seq] Every
NDATA message MUST include a sequence number.*#
* [tck-testable tck-id-payloads-ndata-seq-inc]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-payloads-ndata-seq-inc] Every
NDATA message MUST include a sequence number value that is one greater than the previous sequence
number sent by the Edge Node. This value MUST never exceed 18446744073709551615 (max value of a
UINT64). If in the previous sequence number sent by the Edge Node was 18446744073709551615, the next
sequence number sent MUST have a value of 0.*#
* [tck-testable tck-id-payloads-ndata-order]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-payloads-ndata-order] All
NDATA messages sent by an Edge Node MUST NOT be sent until all the NBIRTH and all DBIRTH messages
have been published by the Edge Node.*#
* [tck-testable tck-id-payloads-ndata-qos]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-payloads-ndata-qos] NDATA
messages MUST be published with the MQTT QoS set to 0.*#
* [tck-testable tck-id-payloads-ndata-retain]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-payloads-ndata-retain] NDATA
messages MUST be published with the MQTT retain flag set to false.*#

The following is a representation of a simple NDATA message on the topic:

----
spBv1.0/Sparkplug B Devices/NDATA/Raspberry Pi
----

In the topic above the following information is known based on the Sparkplug topic definition:

* The ‘Group ID’ is: Sparkplug B Devices
* The ‘Edge Node ID’ is: Raspberry Pi
* This is an NDATA message based on the 'NDATA' Sparkplug Verb

Consider the following Sparkplug B payload in the NDATA message shown above:

----
{
        "timestamp": 1486144502122,
        "metrics": [{
                "name": "Supply Voltage",
                "timestamp": 1486144502122,
                "dataType": "Float",
                "value": 12.3
        }],
        "seq": 2
}
----

This would result in the host application updating the value of the 'Supply Voltage' metric.

[[payloads_b_ddata]]
==== DDATA

DDATA messages are used to update the values of any device metrics that were originally published in
the DBIRTH message. Any time an input changes on the device, a DDATA message should be generated and
published to the MQTT Server. If multiple metrics on the device change, they can all be included in
a single DDATA message. It is also important to note that changes can be aggregated and published
together in a single DDATA message. Because the Sparkplug B payload uses an ordered List of metrics,
multiple different change events for multiple different metrics can all be included in a single
DDATA message.

* [tck-testable tck-id-payloads-ddata-timestamp]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-payloads-ddata-timestamp] DDATA
messages MUST include a payload timestamp that denotes the time at which the message was
published.*#
* [tck-testable tck-id-payloads-ddata-seq]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-payloads-ddata-seq] Every
DDATA message MUST include a sequence number.*#
* [tck-testable tck-id-payloads-ddata-seq-inc]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-payloads-ddata-seq-inc] Every
DDATA message MUST include a sequence number value that is one greater than the previous sequence
number sent by the Edge Node. This value MUST never exceed 18446744073709551615 (max value of a
UINT64). If in the previous sequence number sent by the Edge Node was 18446744073709551615, the next
sequence number sent MUST have a value of 0.*#
* [tck-testable tck-id-payloads-ddata-order]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-payloads-ddata-order] All
DDATA messages sent by an Edge Node MUST NOT be sent until all the NBIRTH and all DBIRTH messages
have been published by the Edge Node.*#
* [tck-testable tck-id-payloads-ddata-qos]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-payloads-ddata-qos] DDATA
messages MUST be published with the MQTT QoS set to 0.*#
* [tck-testable tck-id-payloads-ddata-retain]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-payloads-ddata-retain] DDATA
messages MUST be published with the MQTT retain flag set to false.*#

The following is a representation of a simple DDATA message on the topic:

spBv1.0/Sparkplug B Devices/DDATA/Raspberry Pi/Pibrella

* The ‘Group ID’ is: Sparkplug B Devices
* The ‘Edge Node ID’ is: Raspberry Pi
* The ‘Device ID’ is: Pibrella
* This is an DDATA message based on the 'NDATA' Sparkplug Verb

Consider the following Sparkplug B payload in the DDATA message shown above:

----
{
        "timestamp": 1486144502122,
        "metrics": [{
                "name": "Inputs/A",
                "timestamp": 1486144502122,
                "dataType": "Boolean",
                "value": true
        }, {
                "name": "Inputs/C",
                "timestamp": 1486144502122,
                "dataType": "Boolean",
                "value": true
        }],
        "seq": 0
}
----

This would result in the Host Application updating the value of the ‘Inputs/A’ metric and ‘Inputs/C’ 
metric.

[[payloads_b_rebirth]]
==== REBIRTH

REBIRTH messages are used by Host Applications to resync with an Edge Nodes existing data stream.

* [tck-testable tck-id-payloads-rebirth-timestamp]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-payloads-rebirth-timestamp] REBIRTH
messages MUST include a payload timestamp that denotes the time at which the message was
published.*#
* [tck-testable tck-id-payloads-rebirth-seq]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-payloads-rebirth-seq] Every
REBIRTH message MUST NOT include a sequence number.*#
* [tck-testable tck-id-payloads-rebirth-qos]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-payloads-rebirth-qos] REBIRTH
messages MUST be published with the MQTT QoS set to 0.*#
* [tck-testable tck-id-payloads-rebirth-retain]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-payloads-rebirth-retain] REBIRTH
messages MUST be published with the MQTT retain flag set to false.*#
* [tck-testable tck-id-payloads-rebirth-source-metric-1]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-payloads-rebirth-source-metric-1] REBIRTH
messages MUST include a metric in the payload with the name of 'source', the dataType MUST be
'String', and the value MUST be the Sparkplug Host ID of the requesting Sparkplug Host
Application.*#

The following is a representation of a REBIRTH message on the topic:

----
spBv1.0/Sparkplug B Devices/REBIRTH/Raspberry Pi
----

* The ‘Group ID’ is: Sparkplug B Devices
* The ‘Edge Node ID’ is: Raspberry Pi
* This is an REBIRTH message based on the 'REBIRTH' Sparkplug Verb

Consider the following Sparkplug B payload in the NCMD message shown above:

----
{
        "timestamp": 1486144502122,
        "metrics": [{
                "name": "source",
                "timestamp": 1486144502122,
                "dataType": "String",
                "value": "IamHost"
        }]
}
----

This REBIRTH payload tells the Edge Node to publish NREBIRTH and DREBIRTH(s) messages. This can be
requested if a Host Application gets an out of order seq number or if a metric arrives in an NDATA
or DDATA message that was not provided in the original NBIRTH or DBIRTH messages.

[[payloads_b_ncmd]]
==== NCMD

NCMD messages are used by Host Applications to write to Edge Node outputs and send Node Control
commands to Edge Nodes. Multiple metrics can be supplied in a single NCMD message.

* [tck-testable tck-id-payloads-ncmd-timestamp]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-payloads-ncmd-timestamp] NCMD
messages MUST include a payload timestamp that denotes the time at which the message was
published.*#
* [tck-testable tck-id-payloads-ncmd-seq]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-payloads-ncmd-seq] Every NCMD
message MUST NOT include a sequence number.*#
* [tck-testable tck-id-payloads-ncmd-qos]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-payloads-ncmd-qos] NCMD
messages MUST be published with the MQTT QoS set to 0.*#
* [tck-testable tck-id-payloads-ncmd-retain]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-payloads-ncmd-retain] NCMD
messages MUST be published with the MQTT retain flag set to false.*#

The following is a representation of a simple NCMD message on the topic:

----
spBv1.0/Sparkplug B Devices/NCMD/Raspberry Pi
----

* The ‘Group ID’ is: Sparkplug B Devices
* The ‘Edge Node ID’ is: Raspberry Pi
* This is an NCMD message based on the 'NDATA' Sparkplug Verb

Consider the following Sparkplug B payload in the NCMD message shown above:

----
{
        "timestamp": 1486144502122,
        "metrics": [{
                "name": "DIGITAL_OUT_1",
                "timestamp": 1486144502122,
                "dataType": "Boolean",
                "value": true
        }]
}
----

The NCMD payload tells the Edge Node to write true to the 'DIGITAL_OUT_1' metric. As a result, the
DIGITAL_OUT_1 alue should turn true and result in a NDATA message back to the MQTT Server after the
DIGITAL_OUT_1 is successfully set to true.

[[payloads_b_dcmd]]
==== DCMD

DCMD messages are used by Host Applications to write to device outputs and send Device Control
commands to devices. Multiple metrics can be supplied in a single DCMD message.

* [tck-testable tck-id-payloads-dcmd-timestamp]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-payloads-dcmd-timestamp] DCMD
messages MUST include a payload timestamp that denotes the time at which the message was
published.*#
* [tck-testable tck-id-payloads-dcmd-seq]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-payloads-dcmd-seq] Every DCMD
message MUST NOT include a sequence number.*#
* [tck-testable tck-id-payloads-dcmd-qos]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-payloads-dcmd-qos] DCMD
messages MUST be published with the MQTT QoS set to 0.*#
* [tck-testable tck-id-payloads-dcmd-retain]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-payloads-dcmd-retain] DCMD
messages MUST be published with the MQTT retain flag set to false.*#

The following is a representation of a simple DCMD message on the topic:

----
spBv1.0/Sparkplug B Devices/DCMD/Raspberry Pi/Pibrella
----

* The ‘Group ID’ is: Sparkplug B Devices
* The ‘Edge Node ID’ is: Raspberry Pi
* The ‘Device ID’ is: Pibrella
* This is an DCMD message based on the 'DCMD' Sparkplug Verb

Consider the following Sparkplug B payload in the DCMD message shown above:

----
{
        "timestamp": 1486144502122,
        "metrics": [{
                "name": "Outputs/LEDs/Green",
                "timestamp": 1486144502122,
                "dataType": "Boolean",
                "value": true
        }, {
                "name": "Outputs/LEDs/Yellow",
                "timestamp": 1486144502122,
                "dataType": "Boolean",
                "value": true
        }]
}
----

The DCMD payload tells the Edge Node to write true to the attached device’s green and yellow LEDs.
As a result, the LEDs should turn on and result in a DDATA message back to the MQTT Server after the
LEDs are successfully turned on.

[[payloads_b_ndeath]]
==== NDEATH

The NDEATH messages are registered with the MQTT Server in the MQTT CONNECT packet as the 'Will
Message'. This is used by Host Applications to know when an Edge Node has lost its MQTT connection
with the MQTT Server.

* [tck-testable tck-id-payloads-ndeath-seq]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-payloads-ndeath-seq] Every
NDEATH message MUST NOT include a sequence number.*#
* [tck-testable tck-id-payloads-ndeath-will-message]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-payloads-ndeath-will-message] An
NDEATH message MUST be registered as a Will Message in the MQTT CONNECT packet.*#
* [tck-testable tck-id-payloads-ndeath-will-message-qos]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-payloads-ndeath-will-message-qos] The
NDEATH message MUST set the MQTT Will QoS to 1 in the MQTT CONNECT packet.*#
* [tck-testable tck-id-payloads-ndeath-will-message-retain]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-payloads-ndeath-will-message-retain] The
NDEATH message MUST set the MQTT Will Retained flag to false in the MQTT CONNECT packet.*#
* [tck-testable tck-id-payloads-ndeath-bdseq]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-payloads-ndeath-bdseq] The
NDEATH message MUST include the same bdSeq number value that will be used in the associated NBIRTH message.*#
** This is used by Host Applications to correlate the NDEATH messages with a previously received NBIRTH
message.
** It is important to note that any new CONNECT packet must increment the bdSeq number in the
payload compared to what was in the previous CONNECT packet. This ensures that any Host Applications
will be able to distinguish between current and old bdSeq numbers in the event that messages are
delivered out of order. When incrementing the bdSeq number, if the previous value was
18446744073709551615 (max value of a UINT64), the next value must be zero.
* [tck-testable tck-id-payloads-ndeath-will-message-publisher]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-payloads-ndeath-will-message-publisher] An
NDEATH message SHOULD be published by the Edge Node before it intentionally disconnects from the
MQTT Server.*#
** This allows Host Applications advanced notice that an Edge Node has disconnected rather than
waiting for the NDEATH to be delivered by the MQTT Server based on an MQTT keep alive timeout.
* [tck-testable tck-id-payloads-ndeath-will-message-publisher-disconnect-mqtt311]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-payloads-ndeath-will-message-publisher-disconnect-mqtt311] If
the Edge Node is using MQTT 3.1.1 and it sends an MQTT DISCONNECT packet, the Edge Node MUST publish
an NDEATH message to the MQTT Server before it sends the MQTT DISCONNECT packet.*#
** This is to ensure Host Applications are notified that the Edge Node is disconnecting. Because an
MQTT DISCONNECT packet is sent, the MQTT Server will not deliver the Will Message/NDEATH on behalf
of the disconnecting Edge Node.
* [tck-testable tck-id-payloads-ndeath-will-message-publisher-disconnect-mqtt50]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-payloads-ndeath-will-message-publisher-disconnect-mqtt50] If
the Edge Node is using MQTT 5.0 and it sends an MQTT DISCONNECT packet, the MQTT v5.0 'Disconnect
with Will Message' reason code MUST be set in the DISCONNECT packet.*#
** This is to ensure Host Applications are notified that the Edge Node is disconnecting by the MQTT
Server.
* An NDEATH message MAY include a timestamp.
** It should be noted that this timestamp is typically set at the time of the MQTT CONNECT message
and as a result may not be useful to Host Applications. If the timestamp is set, Host Applications
SHOULD NOT use it to determine corresponding NBIRTH messages. Instead, the bdSeq number used in the
NBIRTH and NDEATH messages MUST be used to determine that an NDEATH matches a prior NBIRTH.

The following is a representation of a NDEATH message on the topic:

----
spBv1.0/Sparkplug B Devices/NDEATH/Raspberry Pi
----

* The ‘Group ID’ is: Sparkplug B Devices
* The ‘Edge Node ID’ is: Raspberry Pi
* This is an NDEATH message based on the 'NDEATH' Sparkplug Verb

Consider the following Sparkplug B payload in the NDEATH message shown above:

----
{
        "timestamp": 1486144502122,
        "metrics": [{
                "name": "bdSeq",
                "timestamp": 1486144502122,
                "dataType": "UInt64",
                "value": 0
        }]
}
----

The payload metric named bdSeq allows a Host Application to reconcile this NDEATH with the NBIRTH
that occurred previously.

[[payloads_b_ddeath]]
==== DDEATH

The DDEATH messages are published by an Edge Node on behalf of an attached device. If the Edge Node
determines that a device is no longer accessible (i.e. it has turned off, stopped responding, etc.)
the Edge Node should publish a DDEATH to denote that device connectivity has been lost.

* [tck-testable tck-id-payloads-ddeath-timestamp]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-payloads-ddeath-timestamp] DDEATH
messages MUST include a payload timestamp that denotes the time at which the message was
published.*#
* [tck-testable tck-id-payloads-ddeath-seq]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-payloads-ddeath-seq] Every
DDEATH message MUST include a sequence number.*#
* [tck-testable tck-id-payloads-ddeath-seq-inc]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-payloads-ddeath-seq-inc] Every
DDEATH message MUST include a sequence number value that is one greater than the previous sequence
number sent by the Edge Node. This value MUST never exceed 18446744073709551615 (max value of a
UINT64). If in the previous sequence number sent by the Edge Node was 18446744073709551615, the next
sequence number sent MUST have a value of 0.*#

The following is a representation of a simple DDEATH message on the topic:

----
spBv1.0/Sparkplug B Devices/DDEATH/Raspberry Pi/Pibrella
----

* The ‘Group ID’ is: Sparkplug B Devices
* The ‘Edge Node ID’ is: Raspberry Pi
* The ‘Device ID’ is: Pibrella
* This is a DDEATH message based on the 'DDEATH' Sparkplug Verb

Consider the following Sparkplug B payload in the DDEATH message shown above:

----
{
        "timestamp": 1486144502122,
        "seq": 123
}
----

[tck-testable tck-id-payloads-ddeath-seq-number]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-payloads-ddeath-seq-number] A
sequence number MUST be included with the DDEATH messages so the Host Application can ensure order
of messages and maintain the state of the data.*#

[[payloads_b_state]]
==== STATE

As noted previously, the STATE messages published by Sparkplug Host Applications do not use
Sparkplug B payloads. State messages are used by Sparkplug Host Applications to denote to Edge Nodes
whether or not the Sparkplug Host Application is online and operational or not.

* [tck-testable tck-id-payloads-state-will-message]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-payloads-state-will-message] Sparkplug
Host Applications MUST register a Will Message in the MQTT CONNECT packet on the topic
'spBv1.0/STATE/[sparkplug_host_id]'.*#
** The [sparkplug_host_id] should be replaced with the Sparkplug Host Application's ID. This can be any
UTF-8 string.

* [tck-testable tck-id-payloads-state-subscribe]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-payloads-state-subscribe] After
establishing an MQTT connection, the Sparkplug Host Application MUST subscribe on it's own
'spBv1.0/STATE/[sparkplug_host_id]' topic.*#
** The [sparkplug_host_id] should be replaced with the Sparkplug Host Application's ID. This can be
any UTF-8 string.
** Non-normative comment: This allows the Sparkplug Host Application handle timing issues around
STATE 'offline' messages being published on it's behalf by the MQTT Server when it is in fact
online.
